That's my ramdom repository. you can see a song txt file and so on. you can try out my song list or redirect to my spotify libary by the link given in another file called like songlink.txt. 
I droped a website cuz I thought that was a warm-up and insperatuon for me. 
you should store your code files in repository and you will understand why i told that later.
